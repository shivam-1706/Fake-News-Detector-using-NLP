# Basics of Python, Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas
## Python

Let us start this project by learning about Python. This is one of the easiest languages to learn. Prior coding experience might be useful but not necessary.
Here are some resources to get started:
- [Youtube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?si=kxQhvVWxmTY-IR6s)
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)

You need not watch the complete video. Just make sure you know about the basic data types, conditional expressions, loops , functions and modules.

## Numpy
NumPy, or Numerical Python, is a Python library widely used to operate on vectors and matrices (or numpy arrays) . 
It is arguably the most important Python library when it comes to developing neural networks and in data science in general. 
A major reason for NumPy's popularity is its use of vectorization, which greatly speeds up computations involving arrays, as compared to traditional Python lists.

Here are some tutorials:
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp)
- [Offical Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

## Matplotlib
You can look up what plot you want at any point or

## Pandas
Pandas is a fast and flexible library used for data analysis with an easy to use interface.
Check this [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS&si=HNFlzyyiy70gPZfH) to learn about this library.

If you encounter any difficulties while solving the assignments, refer to the official documentation of these two libraries for guidance.


## Jupyter Notebooks

Instead of writing the traditional python scripts, we will be using **Jupyter Notebooks** to run python code.


They allow for interactive coding, making it easy to run code snippets and see results immediately.
Checkout this [video](https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk?si=ur1Cqn8wDdcfwuUf&t=163) to learn how to install the required software and how to create and run **.ipynb** files


If you wish to work on VS Code itself, you may checkout this [video](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).


## Git and Github
Though it's not necessary to go into the details of git for this project, having knowledge of a few basic commands would be helpful.
Here's a link to the official [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world). You only need to know the commands given in the __Hello World__ page.
